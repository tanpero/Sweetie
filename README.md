# Sweetie: A Modern Regular Expression Engine In C++

---
## Overview

Sweetie is an experimental regular expression engine implemented in C++ by student Camille Dolma, with the primary goal of progressively establishing a superset of "regular expression features" from various popular languages. It prioritizes comprehensive functionality and provides robust Unicode support from the outset to address the complex text processing needs of internationalized real-world scenarios. Sweetie aims to explore the feasibility of implementing a full-featured regular expression engine from scratch and to investigate a variety of optimization strategies, both established and experimental.

## Dependencies

A compiler that supports C++20 is required. (Although, at present, there is minimal utilization of newer C++ language features.)

Sweetie does not rely on any third-party libraries.
